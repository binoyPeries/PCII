CS2212 - Project

Our goal in this project was to classify anomalies in Gastrointestinal Tract through Endoscopic Imagery with Deep Learning. For this purpose, we developed four models (one base model, three transfer learning models). Out of these models, the model integrated with InceptionV3 produced the best results, with a validation accuracy was 92.58%. in this model first we extracted and flattened the feature vector from InceptionV3, and the resultant vector was sent through three dense layers and the final classification was obtained.
